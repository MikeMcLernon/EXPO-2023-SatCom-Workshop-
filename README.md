# Full Repository Name 
EXPO-2023-SatCom_Workshop 

This repo contains the files required to run the 2023 MATLAB&reg; EXPO hands-on  
SatCom workshop.  The "Work Scripts" files require code additions in order to  
run.  The "Solution Scripts" files have the required code additions, and run  
to completion.

The files enable the following exercises:  
1.  Exercise 1 - Launch a satellite scenario viewer.  
2.  Exercise 2 - Perform a satellite-to-ground station visibility analysis.  
3.  Extra credit - Perform a satellite-to-ground station communications  
    link closure analysis.

All the exercises include visualizations.
